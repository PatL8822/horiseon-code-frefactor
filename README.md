# <Horiseon-code-refractor>

## Description

Horisen requested for a refraction of there web page. I over looked the source code and noticed the HTML had no structure.
I changed the HTML tags so the elements would be semantic and uphold structure. Linked the "search Engine Optimization" nav element
so it will redirect to that section on the page. Cleaned up the Css file from redundant information. Added a background color on hover
to the nav elements. Gave the images "alt" attributes. Updated the tittle to the web page.
